**I used Microsoft SSMS to combine 2 datasets from kaggle.com to come up with a query to find the highest scoring cities for work life balance that also has the most Subway restaurant locations**

SELECT TOP 10 dbo.Cities.City, ROUND(dbo.Cities.Score,2) AS Score, COUNT(dbo.Subway.city) AS Store_Total
FROM dbo.Cities
JOIN dbo.Subway ON dbo.Cities.City = dbo.Subway.city
GROUP BY dbo.Cities.City, dbo.Cities.Score
HAVING  COUNT(dbo.Subway.city) > 65 AND dbo.Cities.Score > 72
ORDER BY Store_Total desc;




City	        Score	     Store_Total
Houston	      79.89	      218
Chicago	      82.92	      215
San Antonio	  81.46     	119
Los Angeles	  81.62     	114
Las Vegas	    79.47	      109
Miami	        82.83	      103
Columbus	    83.05      	97
Dallas	      81.74	      82
New York	    84.23      	80
Phoenix     	81.46	      78
